# Radio stations built from a music library: genre playlists, on-demand
# encoders, a DJ that talks between the songs, and a web remote. Optionally a
# stand-in for vTuner, so an older Yamaha receiver's "Net Radio" input works
# again after vTuner went pay-to-use.
#
# Everything site-specific is an option — see `options.services.netradio`
# below. The smallest useful configuration is a domain and a library:
#
#     services.netradio = {
#       enable = true;
#       domain = "radio.example.com";
#       libraryRoots = [ "/srv/music" ];
#     };
#
# That gives the stations, the page and the admin UI. The receiver stand-in
# (`vtuner.*`), this machine's own sound card (`speaker.*`), receiver controls
# (`receiver.*`), the DJ's voice (`tts.*`) and agent-written feed rules
# (`compile.*`) are each off until asked for.
#
# --- the vTuner stand-in, when enabled ---------------------------------------
# How the receiver finds radio at all: it looks up radioyamaha.vtuner.com,
# speaks plain HTTP on port 80 to whatever answers, and plays the stream URLs
# it is handed. So:
#
#   receiver ──DNS──▶ Blocky: radioyamaha.vtuner.com = this box (LAN IP)
#            ──:80──▶ nginx vhost radioyamaha.vtuner.com
#                       /            → YCast (vTuner emulation, 127.0.0.1:8010)
#                                      • Radiobrowser: the community index
#                                        (genres / countries / popular)
#                                      • My Stations: the library stations
#                                        below + a few internet radio
#                       /radio/X.mp3 → auth_request → netradio-wake (:8011)
#                                      starts Liquidsoap output X, waits for
#                                      Icecast to list it, then nginx proxies
#                                      the listener to Icecast (127.0.0.1:8020)
#
# Library stations are genre-tag playlists, era-filtered by the profiler's
# audio-quality buckets (netradio-playlists, nightly), fed
# to Icecast by Liquidsoap, sequenced by a DJ (netradio-dj) that queues the
# tracks and every 3-4 of them a Kokoro-voiced break naming what just played
# and what is next. A profiler (netradio-profile, nightly) listens to each
# track once so spoken intros/stage talk cut as their own tracks stay off the
# stations, and songs that start or end in chatter aren't crossfaded over.
# Encoders are ON DEMAND: a station's MP3 encoder
# runs only while someone is listening (+5 min grace), so nine stations idle
# at zero CPU. Nothing here needs a port opened — the receiver only ever
# touches port 80, which is already open and LAN/Tailscale-gated by
# nginx-access.nix. Icecast, YCast and the wake server are loopback-only.
#
# Known limit: the receiver cannot do TLS, and YCast rewrites https:// stream
# URLs to http://. A station that serves HTTPS only will fail to play; the
# Radiobrowser index still has plenty that don't.
#
# Stations, specialty feeds and the schedule are RUNTIME config
# (${stateDir}/config/, seeded once from this file) edited on
# <radio host>/admin. Two kinds of station: CURATED (a broad base
# rule plus a schedule of segments — themed hours drawn from specialty feeds
# or artist spotlights with similar artists mixed in; `auto` slots are the
# DJ's own pick for the day) and SPECIALTY (one feed, listenable on its own).
# A new feed's rule is written by `claude -p` from its description (the
# apply path unit runs it as the claude user); the DJ announces segments as
# they start and the day's schedule at breaks, radio-style.
#
# The page at the configured domain (web/) shows what's playing, the last
# few played, what the DJ queued next, listener counts and a visualiser, and
# serves stations.m3u / .pls for radio apps. Every station also has a
# "-lo" mount at 96 kbps (cellular). Nothing here needs a port opened.
#
# Ops:
#   sudo cat /var/lib/netradio/credentials.env      Icecast passwords (generated)
#   <radio host>/admin                              feeds, schedule, stations (the config)
