"""The Liquidsoap script has to PARSE, and that is not checked anywhere else.

`netradio liq` renders /run/netradio/netradio.liq at service start, so a typo
in the template is found by Liquidsoap itself — at which point every station is
off the air at once and the page shows a wall of dead mounts. The same shape as
the nginx lesson in this repo: a green `nix build` is not the same as the
daemon accepting its config.

`liquidsoap --check` parses AND type-checks without opening a single output, so
it is safe to run in a build. It is the only thing that would catch calling a
method a source does not have — `q.set_queue([])` in the flush command, say.

Point NETRADIO_LIQUIDSOAP at the binary to run this; without it the parse test
skips, so a plain `python3 -m unittest` on a machine with no Liquidsoap still
works. The Nix build always sets it.

Unlike the other two build-time checks this one IMPORTS the package rather than
reading files, so the build puts a directory actually named `netradio` on
PYTHONPATH — a store path is called <hash>-netradio, which is not importable.
