// Library radio — what the two pages agree on, to the byte.
//
// app.js (the phone) and desktop.js (the wide player) grew side by side and
// drifted: 82 method names in common, and a `SpeakerTargetParity` test class
// that exists only to catch that drift. Every change this month — reconnect,
// the view handover, mute reaching the rain bed, the OS transport — had to be
// written twice, in two files, and reviewed twice.
//
// This is the half of that duplication with NO judgement in it: members whose
// bodies are byte-identical in both files today. They move here and both pages
// mix this in. Vue's merge gives a component's OWN options priority, so a page
// that genuinely differs simply keeps its version and wins — which is why only
// the identical ones are here, and why moving them cannot change behaviour.
//
// The 45 members that differ stay where they are, deliberately. Some of those
// differences are real features rather than drift (the phone's playTarget
// drives tuner presets and Pandora stations; the desktop's does neither), and
// reconciling them is a decision per member, not a refactor.
//
// Loads after radio.js — whose getJSON/call/mountsOf these use — and before
// the page's own script.

// ~5 minutes of trying at the 8 s ceiling. A deploy takes about a minute;
// beyond this the station is probably gone rather than restarting.
