"""`netradio resume` — put the receiver back on the station it was playing.

Every encoder restarts when Liquidsoap does, which is any deploy that changes
the package, and that drops every listener for a moment. The browser pages
reconnect by themselves (since 2026-09-29 — before that they said "stream error
— try again" and stopped, which is how this comment came to be wrong) and the
local speaker has a watchdog that restarts its player. A receiver does not: an
R-N301 goes to Stop and stays there. On 2026-09-27 Chris
reported no audio on Classic Country in the living room four hours after the
deploy that had silenced it, and nothing was broken — the receiver had simply
stopped and nobody had told it to start again.

So this runs after Liquidsoap and puts it back. It is somebody's living room,
so the guardrails are the point:

  * only if the receiver is already POWERED ON — it never wakes a unit
  * only if it is already on the receiver's net-radio INPUT — never switches
  * only if it is NOT already playing something
  * only to a station it was genuinely observed playing, remembered by the
    receiver poller in <now>/receiver.json
  * never touches volume, and never touches mute

If any of those does not hold it does nothing and logs which one, because a box
that quietly drives a stereo is worse than one that quietly does not.

It also waits for the station's encoder to be awake before telling the receiver
to play: the encoders are on demand, and a receiver that asks half a second too
early gets a 404 from Icecast and stops again — which is the failure this exists
to clear, arrived at by a different road.
