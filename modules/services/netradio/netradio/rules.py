"""The rules: what the facts in profile.json mean for a station.

profile.json holds only what was MEASURED per track (netradio profile — a
few hours of listening for the whole library). This file turns those facts
into verdicts, and is evaluated every time the scanner or the DJ reads the
profile — so changing a threshold, or adding a filter over facts already
measured, takes effect the same night with no re-listening. A rule that
needs a new fact adds it to `Facts` in profile.py and is measured on the
next pass (the cache key is the file, so only the field's absence triggers
re-analysis if you bump PROFILE_VERSION there).

Add a filter: write a function over (path, facts, title) that returns the
tag names it asserts, and list it in RULES. Tags are what consumers act on:

  talk        keep the track off every station (the scanner drops it)
  head_talk   starts with chatter: the DJ doesn't fade the previous song in
              over it, and gives the previous song a short exit
  tail_talk   ends with chatter: the DJ lets it finish, no crossfade
  hard_stop   ends on a stop, not a fade (the bluegrass ending): the DJ lets
              it land — no fade-out, no overlap, then the next song
  gain_db     what to amplify the track by so it plays at the station's
              target loudness (Sound Check, done our way): from the
              measured EBU R128 loudness, capped so the true peak can't clip

and an `era` — an audio-quality bucket, not a date (the library's dates are
reissue dates): `shellac` (old scratchy records), `vintage` (tape era),
`hifi` (modern). Stations filter on it. Empty when the track was profiled
before era facts existed.
