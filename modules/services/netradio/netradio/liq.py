"""Generate the Liquidsoap script from the runtime station list.

Stations are runtime config now (the admin page adds specialty feeds), and
each needs its own outputs, so the script is rendered at service start
from stations.json rather than baked into the flake. Adding a station =
save + apply (the apply path unit restarts Liquidsoap).
