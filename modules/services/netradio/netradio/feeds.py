"""Feed rules: what puts a track into a feed.

A feed's rule is a small structured object — no query language to parse:

    artists      ["Bob Wills", "Asleep at the Wheel"]   name match, normalised
    genres       ["western swing", "honky tonk"]        whole word in the genre tag
    instruments  {"banjo": [0.3, null], "singing": [null, 0.05]}
                                                        YAMNet means, ALL must hold
    era          {"only": ["shellac"], "exclude": ["shellac"]}
    exclude_genres ["bluegrass", "old time"]           any hit keeps the track OUT
    all          true                                   everything (era still applies)

Each clause that is present must hold: artists/genres together say WHO or
WHAT (a track needs to hit one of them), instruments say how it sounds (all
thresholds), era says when — so "old-time fiddle" is genres [old time] AND
violin >= 0.15, and "banjo instrumentals" is instruments alone. `all` stands
in for the who/what clause. Talk tracks are kept out of everything by the
scanner before rules run. The AI compile step writes rules of exactly this
shape from a feed's description; Chris can edit them by hand.
