"""What the listener thinks of a track, and what that does to how often it plays.

Two gestures, and they are deliberately not symmetrical.

  SKIP    skips the track now AND counts against it. Pressed once it is a
          shrug; pressed on the same track repeatedly it stops coming back.
          Nothing has to be declared "never" for that to happen.
  HEART   a TOGGLE, not a tally, and it lives in Jellyfin. A hearted track
          plays more often. That is all it does.

Chris settled the positive side on 2026-09-27: "It\'s not cumulative, it\'s just
a toggle. Heart tracks play more often. That\'s all. Simplify the heuristic and
[it] doesn\'t throw the station off balance if somebody clicks the thumb too many
times." A counter can be pressed twenty times; a flag cannot, so the boost is
bounded by construction rather than by a cap bolted on afterwards.

The weights:

    skips     0     1     2     3     4+
    weight    1    1/2   1/4   1/8   out

    hearted:  4x, whatever the skips say — the heart is the more deliberate
              gesture, and a track someone went and favourited should not be
              quietly suppressed because they skipped it one distracted evening

Skips are still a running count, because "less of this" only means anything if
it accumulates. There is no artist score here: `dislikes.json` already carries an
explicit "less of this artist", and a second, implicit artist penalty was a way
for one skipped song to quietly mute a whole catalogue.
