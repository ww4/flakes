"""The DJ: pick the tracks, and every few of them say what just played and
what is next.

Liquidsoap on its own does not know what comes next, so the DJ owns the
sequencing. Per station it keeps a Liquidsoap request queue two items ahead;
because it chose the tracks it knows the previous few and the next one
exactly. Every 3-4 tracks it writes a break — a few sentences from templates
with the wording varied so it doesn't repeat — renders it with Kokoro while
the current song plays, and queues it between tracks. If the DJ is down the
station's plain shuffle playlist takes over (a fallback in the Liquidsoap
script), so the worst case is today's behaviour.

Queues are kept filled even while a station's encoder is off: nothing plays
until someone tunes in, the two waiting tracks then play first, and their
announcement is generated only when it is about to be queued — so it is
never stale.
