"""Segments and spotlights: when a curated station plays something narrower
than its base, and what the DJ says about it.

A slot (schedule.json):

    {"id": "country-sat-swing", "station": "country", "name": "Western Swing Hour",
     "kind": "feed" | "artist" | "auto",
     "feed": "western-swing" | "artist": "George Jones" | "like": "feed" | "artist",
     "days": "daily" | "weekdays" | "weekends" | ["mon", "sat"],
     "start": "13:00", "minutes": 60}

`auto` slots are filled by the DJ once per day: something compatible with
the station that hasn't been picked for that slot recently (picks.json
remembers), so a spotlight Chris set up once keeps happening with a
different artist each time even when he sets nothing.

An auto artist spotlight goes to someone quintessential — Chris, after a
country spotlight landed on Michael Martin Murphey's one Christmas album:
"choose artists which are quintessential and good representatives of the
genre and the station — and something we have plenty of". So the pick is
weighted by how much of the artist we own (tracks, across several albums),
how much of it is tagged into the station's family, and how much of it the
audio classifier hears as that family; the top of that list is drawn from,
not the whole roster.
