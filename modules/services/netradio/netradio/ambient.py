"""`netradio ambient` — fetch the ambient beds (rain) a fixed station loops.

A fixed station's playlist is not built from the library: it points at a
handful of long recordings kept in <state>/ambient/<name>/. This fetches
them from the Internet Archive — freely licensed recordings only, which
also happen to loop better than the short clips a streaming site serves
(longer takes, no re-download when someone's CDN moves) — and writes
playlists/<mount>.m3u.

    netradio ambient --dir /var/lib/netradio/ambient --playlist /var/lib/netradio/playlists/rain.m3u

Idempotent: a file already on disk with the right size is left alone, so
this can run at boot and after every deploy. Add your own recordings by
dropping them in the directory; anything readable there is played.
