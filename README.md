# Flakes

This is the next phase of my journey towards "infrasructure as code". I am building flakes to deploy my personal computers, workstations, and laptops. This is a public repo, feel free to copy anything useful here!

I am following a tutorial series from Matthias Benaets 
His Github: https://github.com/MatthiasBenaets

(this will need updated as I continue to add things...)
